ZK-Trace: A Private & Verifiable Supply Chain DApp
ZK-Trace is a proof-of-concept decentralized application (DApp) built for the DEV.to Midnight Network "Privacy First" Challenge. It demonstrates how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can revolutionize supply chain management by enabling private and verifiable tracking of high-value goods.

The Problem
Traditional supply chains suffer from a lack of transparency and are vulnerable to fraud, counterfeiting, and data breaches. While public blockchains offer transparency, they expose sensitive business data (e.g., supplier relationships, transaction volumes) to the public and competitors.

The Solution: ZK-Trace
ZK-Trace leverages a privacy-first blockchain architecture (simulated for this demo) to create a system where:

Ownership is Verifiable: The entire history of a product is immutably stored and can be audited.

Data is Private: Sensitive details of transactions are kept confidential using zero-knowledge proofs. A company can prove it legitimately owns a product in order to transfer it, without revealing who they acquired it from or when.

Trust is Enhanced: Consumers and partners can trust the authenticity of a product by viewing its shielded history, increasing confidence and combating counterfeiting.

This project is submitted to the "Protect That Data" category.

ðŸ§  Understanding the Technology
To fully appreciate how ZK-Trace works, it helps to understand a few core concepts.

Blockchain Basics
At its heart, a blockchain is a secure, shared digital record book. Think of it as a ledger that is distributed across many computers, making it extremely difficult to tamper with. Every transaction (like transferring a product) is a new entry that is permanently recorded.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
This is the "magic" that enables privacy. A ZKP allows one person to prove to another that they know a secret, without revealing the secret itself.

Analogy: You can prove you have the key to a box by describing a unique, hidden item inside it, without ever showing the key itself. In ZK-Trace, a user can prove they own a product (the secret) to the network in order to transfer it, without revealing their identity or transaction history.

Modern Frontend Development
The user interface is built with modern web technologies to create a fast and responsive experience.

React: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and a clean, modern design.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
This project is a self-contained index.html file that requires no complex setup, build steps, or dependencies beyond a modern web browser.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

A live internet connection (to load CDN assets like Tailwind CSS and React).

Running the Application
Download the Code:

Clone the repository or simply download the index.html file.

Open the File:

Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the index.html file into an open browser window.

That's it! The application will load and be fully interactive.

How to Use ZK-Trace
The application simulates a multi-user environment. You can switch between different users to experience the ownership and transfer process.

Switch Users: Use the dropdown menu at the top to switch between user_alice, user_bob, and user_charlie.

View Products:

The "My Products" section shows items owned by the currently selected user.

The "All Products" section shows every item on the simulated network. Products you own are highlighted with a cyan border.

Transfer Ownership:

You can only transfer products you own. Click the "Transfer Ownership" button on a product in the "My Products" section.

A modal will appear. Enter the ID of the new owner (e.g., if you are user_alice, you could transfer to user_bob).

Click "Confirm Transfer". In the background, the app will simulate the generation and verification of a ZK-proof, then update the product's owner.

View History:

Hover over any product card and click the clipboard icon that appears in the top-right corner.

A drawer will open showing the complete, private ownership history for that item, including transaction hashes and the associated (simulated) ZK-proofs.

Technical Simulation
This DApp is a frontend simulation designed to demonstrate the user experience and core concepts of a ZK-powered application without requiring a full blockchain backend.

State Management: React's useState and useEffect hooks manage the application's state. The state is initialized from a mock database object (MockChainDB).

Midnight Network Simulation: The logic for ZKP generation (ZKCircuits.generateTransferProof) and verification (ZKCircuits.verifyTransferProof) are placeholder functions that log to the console and return success values. This mimics the interaction that would happen with MidnightJS and on-chain smart contracts.

Styling: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
